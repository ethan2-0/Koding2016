            The Spaghetti Compute system works by taking problem requests from customers,<br/>
            and then distributing portions of the problem over a network of machines, <br/>
            which we call "botnet". These machines then take these subproblems, find their<br/>
            solutions by using computation power from a browser, and then sends it back to Spaghetti <br/>Compute’s servers, who then return the results to the customer. This<br/>
            technique of dividing up a large problem into smaller ones is known as<br/>
            mapreduce, and is a commonly used dynamic programming procedure. <br/>
            <br/>Now that you understand what Spaghetti Compute is doing in a general form,<br/>
            let’s explain how we get distributed computation to work. First, we need to<br/>
            understand how Spaghetti Compute structures problems. When customers submit <br/>
            problems to be solved, they use our client Application Protocol Interface (API) <br/>
            to splice the problem into smaller subproblems. These subproblems are called<br/>
            work units, and are given to different machines across the botnet.  <br/>
            <br/>Each machine in the Spaghetti Compute system is actually a browser <br/>
            visiting a webpage with a Spaghetti Compute JavaScript (JS) file embedded<br/>
            onto it. This JS file communicates with Spaghetti Compute servers via<br/>
            HyperText-Transfer-Protocol (HTTP) requests. Machines in the botnet then <br/>
            ask Spaghetti Compute’s servers for a work unit to solve. Once this <br/>
            request has been validated, the machine is assigned a work unit to solve.<br/>
            When the problem is solved, it sends the solution back to the servers at<br/>
            Spaghetti Compute. <br/>
            <br/>Now, the computer on which the browser is running can belong to just<br/>
            about anyone in the world. Anybody who is visiting a website that has a <br/>
            Spaghetti ComputeJS file is a part of the botnet. This is the real beauty<br/>
            of the Spaghetti Compute system. Instead of seeing advertisements, surveys,<br/>
            or subscription requests on websites, people will only get a popup telling <br/>
            them that their computer is being used to solve a work unit. Since our <br/>
            services run on web workers, the calculations are performed off the main<br/>
            thread - this means that clients do not even receive delay when their<br/>
            computers are being used.
